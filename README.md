# Coursera_Project_Network
Clean and analyze social media usage data with Python
This is one of courses from Coursera. They say "In this project, you'll conduct a clean & analysis of Tweets using Python and upload your findings to your Coursera profile to showcase to potential employers." I just performed exactly following their instruction. This was a good practice using major Python libraries.
